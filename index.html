        <div class="inner-content-container">
          <p>
            A relatively recent graduate of George Mason University, I'm fundamentally interested about how to get slower things done quickly (automation), how to make things that are working break (security), and how to make things that are broken work (development).
          </p>
          <p>
            I work at the Crypsis Group as one of their earliest employees (~10 employees at the time, May 2016), and continue to work for them after their <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2020/palo-alto-networks-completes-acquisition-of-the-crypsis-group">Palo Alto Networks acquisition</a>. I had a fairly direct role in a lot of different pots at Crypsis, from leading a incident response R&D project that made millions to working with the Director of IT to get SOC2 Type 1 (company acquired before Type 2 period) for Crypsis. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a remote worker, generally I like to spend a decent amount of my free time in whatever city I'm in. Previously that's been DC and Philadelphia, but I have immediate family in London and NYC and plan to rent in the Central US throughout Spring 2021.

                  Founded an organization from scratch that by the time I left had hundreds of Slack members, hosted  both Linux and Cryptography advocacy workshops, several corporate guest circuits, weekly meetings,  multiple sponsors, enough paperwork for a small enterprise, and  and ran a relatively popular on-site CTF event. We were characterized even from GMU as very "self sustaining" and brought our own presentations week-after-week. While I frequently spoke when nobody else would, by the time I left I was largely just giving weekly announcements and handing it over to students trying to hone their speaking/presentation skills.<br>

                <p class="dark pad-right">
                  As an elected position, I had two primary roles as Systems Administrator.<br>
                  As systems administrator, I supported applications such as URL shorteners, a "What's Open at this hour" application, and more. Monitored and responded to abuse complaints, which was critical having a strong .edu presence under my own school. Some of our apps were so well supported that GMU embedded them into their official apps. As the systems admin, I even signed an MOU alongside the president with Mason Dining around SLAs, etc for our most popular application "What's Open." I also introduced a bug bounty program. I personally found and patched a critical CSRF vulnerability in a relatively popular application.<br>
                  As an executive officer, I had a vote in org matters. I was a significant part of executive  conversations in the organization around events, networking (such as under the Mozilla Open Source Student network), how to handle member disputes, and even having to call a motion of no confidence on the president (unanimously passed) after members and leadership repeatedly complained in camera.

                <p class="dark pad-right">
                  According to the 2020 bylaws, the Undersecretary of IT (seemingly renamed) is as such:<br><br>

                    responsible for serving as a liaison between the students and the university technical community,
                    working with various other entities to disseminate information to the student body, and serving
                    as a technical resource to other areas of Student Government as needed.</b></u> </i><br><br>
                    As Undersecretary of IT, I advocated for 2FA adoption in the university, worked on the official .edu SG website, and tried to address WiFi issues by aggregating data about the problem amongst students. I also attempted to serve as a liaison between STEM majors and the Student Government, which I feel was very productive - after making introductions, a SRCT member took a higher secretary position before I had even left. STEM majors were under-represented in Student Government and I advocated for more outreach.

                  Went to local area middle/high schools advocating for George Mason University STEM programs, helping plan the pre-college program, etc. Quickly funding dried up faculty-side but I continued to advocate for STEM and the university on my own, with my own strategies. <b>I also mentored the CyberPatriot team at Frost Middle School in this same vein</b> after funding dried up and I left the outreach arm.
